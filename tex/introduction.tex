\section{Introduction}

We have sadly (for the topologists), 
or maybe finally (for the algebraists), 
arrived at the final lecture on model categories. 
To make up for it we will try to explain how this topology-motivated structure relates to triangulated categories, 
which after all is the star of this seminar. 
This is done through the notion of stable model categories. 

Since this is one of the last talks in this seminar, 
we will also try to tie some of the previous talks into the theory presented here. 
I also know that the theory presented is highly abstract an difficult, 
so as to not lose everybody (and my self), 
the focus will be on the ideas, 
intuition and connections to what we already understand.
