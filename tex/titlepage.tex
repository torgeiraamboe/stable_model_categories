    During fall 2020 I partook in a master-seminar om triangulated categories. 
    Being a topologist I felt the need to talk about stable model categories, 
    in particular about the category of spectra, 
    and the fact that their homotopy categories are triangulated. 

    These notes are the result of preparing for that talk. 
    They probably contain some errors and are not meant to be polished perfect notes. 

    Due to time conflicts, the proof at the end is not very detailed. 
    Hopefully I will fill in the details later.
